### Stable relase install

- If you want to install the stable releases, go to `chrome://flags` and search for the `#extension-mime-request-handling` flag and set it to `Always prompt for install`.

- Stable installs doesn't work anymore under Chrome because now they only allow installing directly .crx files if the extension is in the Chrome Web Store. To make this work, you will need to follow the [other method of installing the stable version](#alternative-3---stable-read-this-first).

### WIP: bugs and tests

- This is a WIP and sometimes the tweaks may not work. If you know anything to fix these issues, make a PR and I'll see if it is ok.
